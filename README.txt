These sounds were generated on December 10, 2019 using Amazon Polly APIs and Asterisk speech scripts.

The resultant output is most likely the chimera bastard copyright of Amazon, Myself, Allison, Asterisk, et al. Including whomever the Salli voice is based on.
-- Regarding the license, I've uploaded and added LICENSE-asterisk-core-en-1.5 which these voice prompts are based on, making these a derivitive work.
-- Polly doesn't seem to have much in the way of stated concern that I found. https://aws.amazon.com/polly/faqs/


It may not even be legal from Amazon perspective for these files to be available for download in the format, but until I am told otherwise, here it is. They are the programmatic, known and expected outcome of a given set of inputs which are a licensed and properly used property (Asterisk voice prompts).
